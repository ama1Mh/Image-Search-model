# Image Search model

This project is designed to detect and display images that have the same color and shape as the query image. It uses image processing techniques to analyze the color histograms and contours of images in a dataset and determine if they meet the criteria for being similar to the query image.

<p>Features</p>
<li>Extracts color histogram features from images.</li>
<li>Calculates similarity between images based on color histograms and contours.</li>
<li>Displays images that are similar in color and shape to the query image.</li>

<p>Dataset</p>
The dataset should be stored in the image_dataset directory. Each image in the dataset will be processed to extract features and compare with the query image.
